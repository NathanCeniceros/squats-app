### üëè **Motivational Messages**
- Shows a congratulatory pop-up after completing each set, boosting motivation with random encouraging messages.

### üìñ **Persistent Tracking**
- Saves progress to a file (`squats_tracker.txt`) to ensure continuity across sessions.
- Logs all activities (e.g., completed, skipped, undone actions) to `squats_log.txt`.

### üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface**
- Simple, clean design powered by `tkinter`.
- Auto-adjusts to fit content dynamically for intuitive usability.
